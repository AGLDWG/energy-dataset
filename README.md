# NEAR Dataset Catalogue static index
Static HTML &amp; RDF index files for /dataset/energy

This tiny repo contains a couple of files to support the Persistent URI <http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/energy> which gives access to Australia's National Energy Analytics Research (NEAR) Program's catalogue of datasets that are currently published at <https://near.csiro.au/>. Persistent URIs for individual datasets redirect directly to the NEAR catalogue entry, e.g. 

<http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/energy/ca1cf1f5-1884-4756-a05b-42a4bf885744> &rarr; <https://near.csiro.au/assets/ca1cf1f5-1884-4756-a05b-42a4bf885744>

(the entry for the dataset "Aggregated Electricity Price and Demand Data")

The purpose of redirecting `linked.data.gov.au/dataset/energy` to `near.csiro.au` is that, in time, the catalogue of datasets may move from CSIRO and thus `near.csiro.au` won't continued to be used, but `linked.data.gov.au` will remain valid so references to the catalogue and individual datasets will continue to work.
