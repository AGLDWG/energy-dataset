# energy-dataset
Static HTML &amp; RDF files for /dataset/energy

This tiny repo contains a couple of files to support the Persistent URI <http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/energy> which gives access to Australia's National Energy Analytics Research (NEAR) Program's catalogue of datasets that are currently published at <https://near.csiro.au/>.

The purpose of redirecting `linked.data.gov.au/dataset/energy` to `near.csiro.au` is that, in time, the catalogue of datasets may move from CSIRO and thus `near.csiro.au` won;t continued to be used, but `linked.data.gov.au` will remain valid.
